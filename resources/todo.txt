    # to-do list
    TODO - make buttons taller so you don't feel like you're playing kovaks when you try to click each one
    TODO - make a clear button and try to fit that in without ruining the whole 'aesthetic' <- lmao
    TODO - add more loose inputs so it wont throw exceptions if you do '2+2'
    TODO - add more operations like x^2, sqrt(x), logx, and trig functions eventually
    TODO - add console underneath the calculator so user can see exceptions and console logs.

    # done
    # add more buttons like 123456789...
